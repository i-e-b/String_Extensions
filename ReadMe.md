String_Extensions
=================

A big pile of string manipulation methods for C#, to fill in some of the gaps of the default string library.

## Comparison

### CompareWildcard

Match strings to patterns using `*` and `?` placeholders. For when Regex is too much.

### NaturalComparer

A comparer for use in Linq `Sort(...)` that respects numerical ordering.

You can drop this anywhere an IComparer is used on strings. To sort files by name with numbers in the right place:
`new DirectoryInfo(@"C:\temp").GetFiles().Select(f=>f.Name).ToList().Sort(new NaturalComparer());`
Then, given these files (as ordered by default .Net sort)

> File 10, File 11, File 8, File 9

Will be sorted correctly, as would be expected:

> File 8, File 9, File 10, File 11

### EqualsIgnoreNumbers

Compare strings for equality, ignoring the actual values of decimal numbers

`NaturalComparer.EqualsIgnoreNumbers("Added ID 5 to DB","Added ID 201 to DB")` == `true`

`NaturalComparer.EqualsIgnoreNumbers("Added ID 5 to DB","ID 201 Failed")` == `false`

## Parsing

### ToByteArray

Convert hex strings to byte arrays.

Take a string like `BADF00BA` into a byte array. String length should be a multiple of two.

## Replacement

### ReplaceCaseInvariant

Replace string fragments using a case-insensitive search.

Matching is case invariant, replacement is done preserving case.
For example: `"OnCe UpOn A tImE".ReplaceCaseInvariant("TiMe", "Moon") == "OnCe UpOn A Moon"`

### ReplaceAsciiCompatible

Replace latin-like letters and numbers with their ASCII equivalents.

This will replace accented forms with ones that *look* similar, but it
will often destroy or change meaning. Do **NOT** use this to present output
to users. It is intended to use for stored search targets.
This is not exhaustive, and does not handle characters that are not latin-like (e.g. CJK)

`HÉLLO, Åbjørn!".ReplaceAsciiCompatible() == "HELLO, Abjorn!"`

### CamelCaseToWords

Convert `camelCase` or `PascalCase` fused-word strings into space separated words.

`MyABCsDoCamelCasePhrase".ReplaceAsciiCompatible() == "My ABCs Do Camel Case Phrase"`

### Switch case simple

Fast case switching on strings that only makes changes that don't change the number
of characters in the string.

`"123 £%$: AAA aaa ǉ ǆ ß".ToUpperSimple() == "123 £%$: AAA AAA Ǉ Ǆ ß"`

`"123 £%$: AAA aaa Ǉ Ǆ SS".ToLowerSimple() == "123 £%$: aaa aaa ǉ ǆ ss"`

### Switch case of single character

Set casing of characters in the string

`"hello, world".UpperCaseIndex(0) == "Hello, world"`

`"hello, world".UpperCaseIndex(-5) == "hello, World"`

## Searching

### FindCluster

A very simple O(n+m) algorithm for finding clusters of characters in a string.
(i.e. it will find `wxyz` in `abc zwyx abc`, but not in `ab xy ab wz`)

This algorithm will give some false positives where the sum of character values match.

## Substrings

A range of substring before/after first/last instances of a character or string.

### SubstringBefore

Return the substring up to but not including the first instance of string 's'.
If 's' is not found, the entire string is returned.

`"once upon a time".SubstringBefore("upon") == "once "`

### SubstringBeforeLast

Return the substring up to but not including the last instance of string 's'.
If 's' is not found, the entire string is returned.

`"once upon a time up high".SubstringBeforeLast("up") == "once upon a time "`

### SubstringAfter

Return the substring after to but not including the first instance of string 's'.
If 's' is not found, the entire string is returned.

`"it happened once upon a time".SubstringAfter("once") == " upon a time"`

### SubstringAfterLast

Return the substring after to but not including the last instance of string 's'.
If 's' is not found, the entire string is returned.

`"once upon a time".SubstringAfterLast("on") == " a time"`

### IndexAfter / LastIndexAfter

Return the index of the first character after a match.
If match is not found, `-1` is returned.

`"once upon a time".IndexAfter("on") == 2`
`"once upon a time".LastIndexAfter("on") == 9`
